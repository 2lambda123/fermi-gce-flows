# Simulation-inference for the Galactic Center Excess

## TODO

- Update to newer GPU-supported version of SBI, document dependencies
- Add saving and loading model state dicts
- Streamline inference, write separate script to decouple from nb
- Write analysis class
- Generalize simulation script, somewhat clunky atm
